Description: This R package provides a model framework validation framework, with 
    a focus on the agricultural trade modeling method used in GCAM. In particular,
    it includes scripts for running a small-scale agricultural trade-focused partical 
    equilibrium model in R, and provides functions to optimize parameters and validate 
    the model against historical data. The package also documents the model used in 
    paper "The role of global agricultural market integration in multiregional 
    economic modeling: using hindcast experiments to validate an Armington model."
